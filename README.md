## Project Overview  

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Capstone (ML-2)** and demonstrates the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for medical image classification.  
The model learns to classify **chest X-ray images** as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**, automating an essential diagnostic process for respiratory diseases.  

üîó **Live App:** [Pneumonia Detector Streamlit App](https://pneumonia-app-detector.streamlit.app/)

## Problem Statement  


Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs. 
When you have pneumonia, these air sacs fill up with fluid or pus, which can make it hard to breathe and limit the amount of oxygen that gets into your bloodstream. 
Manual analysis of chest X-rays is time-consuming and prone to human error, especially in low-resource medical environments.  

> **Goal:** Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, enabling faster and more accessible diagnosis.

---

## Objectives  

- Preprocess and augment chest X-ray images for training.  
- Build a deep learning model using CNN architecture.  
- Train and evaluate the model for reliable classification.  
- Deploy the trained model as a **Streamlit web app** for live predictions.  
- Visualize performance metrics such as loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix.
